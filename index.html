            This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate 
            classification model from a heterogenous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch.
            Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single 
            type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
            We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and#
            compare it with non-adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our 
            results show that.We conclude that..

            Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
            intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
            learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
                candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
                to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
                Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
                sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
                2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
                presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
                labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
                subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
                learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
                reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
                classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2001)
