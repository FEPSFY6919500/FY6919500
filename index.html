        <p id="Introduction_InText">
This paper aims to show how the geometry and other factors that come into the design of an aircraft affect its stealth performance (radar detection). This field of technology is still recently developed but has had lots of work put into it due to the constantly evolving field of defence that demands competition.         </p>
        <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
Over the past 50 years one design principle of military aircraft has been constantly improving and making them undetectable. Stealth technology has changed aircrafts’ roles in war since its first implementation and is now a vital core to modern fighter planes. Many factors affect aircraft’s stealth performance like the exterior material or the geometry of the plane and these all aims to reduce the chance of being detected. The design of the B-2 bomber reduces its radar cross section down to ‘the size of a golf ball’ and this has allowed for powerful strikes unknown to the target. Modern fighter aircraft are now all built around the same principle of minimizing radar detectability, and this paper aims to explain what factors come into play to help achieve that. This paper will outline how radar detection works and what determines an aircraft’s visibility and then examine how stealth coatings and radar-absorbing materials reduce radar signature followed by an analysis of aircraft geometry and its effect on stealth.         </p>

		<h4> How radar works, what makes something detectable  </h4>
		<p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
Radar technology works on the idea that an electromagnetic wave is emitted from a source (radar system) and then reflected off a target which can then be used to calculate the location or presence of the target (Air and Spaceborne Radar Systems: An Introduction, 2001). When radar signals are sent out some of the electromagnetic wave’s energy is absorbed or just not reflected from the target and therefore not returned to the detector. The amount of energy returned to the detector depends on the radar cross section of the target. Radar cross section is used as a measurement to determine how much energy is returned to the detector (Air and Spaceborne Radar Systems: An Introduction, 2001). The larger the radar cross section the easier it is to detect something via radar. In the figure below you can see the radar cross section of a regular aircraft compared to the radar cross section of an aircraft designed for a low radar signature (Introduction to RF Stealth, 2004, p. 6)		</p>

		<h4> How does stealth coating and RAMs help to reduce radar signature and how does it work   </h4>
		<p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
A factor which affects the radar cross section of an aircraft is the exterior material of the aircraft. Specialised materials designed to absorb electromagnetic waves are now commonly used and these are called radar absorbing materials (Recent advances in stealth coating, 2024, p. 2-5). Lots of materials used as radar absorbing materials are carbon based or resin based. One reason for this is that these materials need to be light. Therefore, materials based off carbon and resin are suitable and allow for different arrangements of atoms to affect the surface of the aircraft. One example of a carbon-based material would be graphene; it is suitable as a radar absorbing material due to it being flexible and able to absorb electromagnetic waves effectively. Another example of a material that is suitable as a radar absorbent material would be carbon nanotubes. Both materials work well but carbon nanotubes typically achieve better results than graphene-based materials as graphene suffers from insufficient properties for impedance matching. Impedance matching is a key factor of radar absorbing materials and ensuring a similar impedance of a material and free space allows for a greater ratio of electromagnetic waves to be absorbed. This change in impedance for graphene causes a greater reflection whereas carbon nanotubes have an impedance which is more like free space and, therefore absorb more. Carbon nanotubes however are harder to work with due to their form and therefore require more planning when implemented into systems for their use (Recent advances in stealth coating, 2024, p. 6-14). 		</p>	
		<h4> How does the geometry of a plane help to reduce radar signature and how does it work </h4>
		<p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
Another way to reduce the radar cross-section of a plane is to reflect the waves away from the receiver from the plane. Waves reflect depending on their angle relative to the surface that they are incident with (Fundamentals of the Physical Theory of Diffraction, 2007) designers of stealth aircraft can use this to their advantage to reduce the number of waves that reflect to the radar system by changing the geometry of the plane. We can see this implemented into early stealth aircraft like the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk where the plane uses flat panels in its design to reflect waves away from the radar system. These angles used were calculated when development of the technology was new and this meant that computing curved stealth shapes was difficult. However, this still proved to designers that the idea worked. When technology advanced, the same principle was applied to other planes and more planes built around the principle of stealth were developed like the Northrop B-2 Spirit. These later designs were developed when computing power had increased which allowed for more complicated geometry and curved designs. Curved designs allow for the radar returned to be from multiple angles which improves overall performance of stealth within a variety of scenarios whilst also allowing for the plane to be more aerodynamic which increases overall performance.  		</p>	
		<h4> Conclusion </h4>
		<p class="ex1" id="Analysis_InText">
This paper examines the factors considered to optimize stealth performance for an aircraft. After looking at all factors of how stealth aircraft are developed and what factors go into them it appears that there are many trade-offs and sacrifices that need to be made for an aircraft to be fully stealth and lots of time needs to be spent designing an aircraft around the idea of being stealth before the design is considered. Stealth is something that needs to be considered at the start of the design process and is not something that can just be added on towards the end of the design of an aircraft. However, this technology is still new, and this research leads to a conclusion that the technology has not reached its full potential and there is much more to be discovered in the future 		</p>
