            This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy. The most accurate 
            classification model from a heterogenous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch.
            Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single 
            type of classification model throughout the process. The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
            We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and#
            compare it with non-adaptive active learning and traditional machine learning approaches. Our 
            results show that.We conclude that..

        <p class="ex1">
            Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
            intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
            learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
                candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
                to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
                Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
                sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
                2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
                presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
                labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
                subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
                learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
                reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
                classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2001)

		<h4> How radar works, what makes something detectable  </h4>
		<p class="ex1">
			Radar technology works on the idea that an electromagnetic wave is emitted from a source (radar system) and then reflected off a target (plane) to reflect a signal back which can then be used to calculate the location or presence of the target. When radar signals are sent out some of the electromagnetic wave’s energy is absorbed or just not reflected from the target and therefore not returned to the detector. The amount of energy returned to the detector depends on the radar cross section of the target. Radar cross section is used as a measurement to determine how detectable a target is. The larger the radar cross section the easier it is to detect something via radar, for example an aircraft carrier could have a radar cross section of 100 000m2 whilst a fighter plane would have a radar cross section of 1-5m2. In the figure below you can see the radar cross section of a regular aircraft compared to the radar cross section of an aircraft designed for a low radar signature 
		</p>	
		<h4> How does stealth coating and RAMs help to reduce radar signature and how does it work   </h4>
		<p class="ex1">
			A factor which affects the radar cross section of an aircraft is the exterior material of the aircraft. Specialised materials designed to absorb electromagnetic waves emitted from a radar system and reduce the overall radar cross section of an aircraft are now commonly used and these are called radar absorbing materials. Lots of materials used as radar absorbing materials are carbon based or resin based. One reason for this is that these materials also need to be light as they are used on aircraft and will be taking up or adding on to the plane that could be used by much more light and efficient materials for flight. Therefore, materials based off carbon and resin are suitable due to allowing for different arrangements of atoms to affect the surface of the aircraft whilst remaining light and not debilitating. One example of a carbon-based material would be graphene, it is suitable as a radar absorbing material due to it being light, flexible and able to absorb electromagnetic waves effectively. Another example of a material that is suitable as a radar absorbent material would be carbon nanotubes. Both materials work well but carbon nanotubes typically achieve better results than graphene-based materials as graphene suffers from insufficient properties for impedance matching. Impedance matching is a key factor of radar absorbing materials and ensuring a similar impedance of a material and free space allows for a greater ratio of electromagnetic waves to be absorbed. This change in impedance for graphene causes a greater reflection whereas carbon nanotubes have an impedance which is more like free space and, therefore absorb more. Carbon nanotubes however are harder to work with due to their form and therefore require more planning when implemented into systems for their use.

		<h4> How does the geometry of a plane help to reduce radar signature and how does it work </h4>
		<p class="ex1">
			Another way to reduce the radar cross-section of a plane is to reflect the waves away from the receiver once they have hit the plane. Waves reflect depending on their angle relative to the surface that they are incident with, designers of stealth aircraft can use this to their advantage to reduce the amount of waves that reflect back to the radar system by changing the geometry of the plane so that the angles that the electromagnetic waves sent by the radar system interfere with the plane at are able to just reflect the waves away from the radar system. We can see this implemented into early stealth aircraft like the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk where the plane uses flat panels in its design to reflect waves away from the radar system. These angles used were calculated when development of the technology was new and this meant that computing curved stealth shapes was difficult. However, this still proved to designers that the idea worked. When technology advanced, the same principle was applied to other planes and more planes built around the principle of stealth were developed like the Northrop B-2 Spirit. These later designs were developed when computing power had increased which allowed for more complicated geometry and curved designs. Curved designs allow for the radar returned to be from multiple angles which improves overall performance of stealth within a variety of scenarios whilst also allowing for the plane to be more aerodynamic which increases overall performance. Other factors considered when designing the geometry of a stealth plane have been concealing weapons and missiles to keep the flat shape which reflects waves in a certain direction from being compromised. The shape of engine intakes and exhausts have also been considered as any of these of a standard plane would make any other adjustments made to the aircraft useless for stealth performance. 
		</p>	
		<h4> Conclusion </h4>
		<p class="ex1">
			This paper examines the factors considered to optimize stealth performance for an aircraft. After looking at all factors of how stealth aircraft are developed and what factors go into them it appears that there are many trade offs and sacrifices that need to be made for an aircraft to be fully stealth and lots of time needs to be spent designing an aircraft around the idea of being stealth before the design is considered. Stealth is something that needs to be considered at the start of the design process and is not something that can just be added on towards the end of the design of an aircraft. However, when researching it was clear that this technology is still very new and leads to a conclusion that the technology has not reached its full potential and therefore there is much more to be discovered for aircraft to reduce their radar signal in the future
